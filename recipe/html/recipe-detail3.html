                <h2>Fettuccine Alfredo</h2>
                <p class="title">Ingredients</p>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>226 grams fettuccine (- ½ pound)</li>
                        <li>6 cups water</li>
                        <li>1 to 1.5 teaspoons salt (or add as required)</li>
                        <li>3 to 4 tablespoons Butter (- 30 grams, unsalted or salted)</li>
                        <li>½ teaspoon garlic (- finely chopped)</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="title">Directions</p>
                <p>In a deep pan or a sauce pan add water and salt. Stir.
                    Place saucepan on stovetop and bring the water to a boil on high heat.
                    Once the water comes to a boil, add the fettuccine pasta or other pasta of choice. Use a spoon to push the fettuccine down into the boiling water as they soften, until fully submerged.
                    Cook pasta according to package instructions or until the al dente. That means cooked through but with a slight bite. Boil fettuccine on medium to high heat.
                    Drain the water, making sure to save and set aside about a ½ cup of the cooked pasta water. You might want to use a bit to thin out the alfredo sauce.
                    Making Alfredo Sauce
                    Meanwhile when the pasta is cooking, begin to make the alfredo sauce. In a large, deep skillet melt salted or unsalted butter on low heat. If using salted butter you’ll want to add less salt to finish the dish.
                    Once the butter has melted, add chopped garlic. Sauté for a few seconds until the raw aroma of garlic goes away. There is no need to brown the garlic.
                    Add the whipping cream. Mix well with a wired whisk. Bring the cream to a gentle boil on low heat.
                    With a whisk continuously stir as you bring the cream mixture to a low simmer on a low heat. Keep an eye on the cream to ensure it does not get burnt or brown.
                    Once the cream begins to gently boil, further simmer for 1 to 2 minutes on low heat, until the cream thickens a bit.
                    Add grated vegetarian parmesan cheese to the cream and mix well.
                    Making Fettuccine Alfredo
                    Add the cooked and drained pasta to the prepared alfredo sauce in the pan
                    With the help of tongs thoroughly mix the pasta and sauce together, so that every pasta is coated in the creamy Alfredo.
                    Continue to cook the fettuccine alfredo on low heat for another minute or two, stirring frequently to keep the pasta from sticking or clumping together. If the sauce becomes too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water, and stir to combine.
                    Taste the dish, and season with salt as needed and crushed black pepper. I also recommend adding a dash of freshly grated nutmeg.
                    Mix again, and turn off the heat.
                    Serving And Storing Suggestions
                    Serve the pasta hot. Garnish fettuccine alfredo with grated vegetarian parmesan cheese and chopped parsley or soft fresh herb of your choice.
                    Store any leftovers in an airtight container for 1 to 2 days in the refrigerator. While reheating, add a bit of water or milk to thin the consistency slightly.
                    Notes
                    Cream: I have used whipping cream in this alfredo sauce recipe. However, for a lighter version you can use low fat/light cream or cooking cream or half and half.
                    Butter: Make the alfredo sauce with salted or unsalted butter. If using salted butter, then be mindful of salt when adding later to the pasta.
                    Seasonings: The seasonings are minimal in this dish. You can spice it up by adding a bit more of crushed black pepper. You can also use white pepper or cayenne pepper.
                    Veggies: My vegetarian recipe of fettuccine alfredo is super simple, but feel free to add your favorite cooked veggies. You can either sauté, steam or roast them. Broccoli, carrots, green peas, sweet corn, mushrooms, bell peppers, baby corn, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach – or any vegetables you like are some delicious options.
                    Pasta: Traditionally, alfredo sauce is served with fettuccine. But you really can use any pasta you prefer or like. Make this delicious alfredo pasta with penne, pappardelle, macaroni, rigatoni, farfalle, or whatever you’ve got.</p>
